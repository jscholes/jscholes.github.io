		<h1>Unexpected Focus Movement</h1>
		<p>This page includes a check box, followed by a text field.</p>
		<p>Start by double tapping on the text field, to show the on-screen keyboard.  Then, double tap the check box to toggle its value.</p>
		<p>Notice that when interaction occurs with the check box, the on-screen keyboard disappears and VoiceOver focus confusingly returns to the text field.  However, document.activeElement (i.e. the system focus) is undefined or on the body.</p>
		<h2>The Fields</h2>
		<form>
			<input id="cb" type="checkbox">
			<label for="cb">Select Something</label>
			<label for="txt">Search Query</label>
			<input id="txt" type="text">
